# Node Login App made for Calibr8 Digital Exam

This app was made as an exercise for my application as a junior full stack developer.

The app uses the Node framework, Express to run as a basic back end login authenticator for the front end React To Do App. A promise function was used to send a response to the front end.

**Enter `nodemon index.js` in the CLI to start the app.**


**Username is `User` and Password is `password`. Any other entered username or password will not work.**

 If the user tries to access the page without logging in, the list will not show and will have a button to redirect them back to the login page.
